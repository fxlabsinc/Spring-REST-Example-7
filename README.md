# Automated API Testing & Security for the Spring REST Hotels App Example

This is a test project hosting all the auto-generated and user-created tests suites for an example Spring REST application that is currently running on AWS.

### How to Run the Spring REST Hotels App Example

This application is packaged as a WAR which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the java -jar command.

* Clone this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/khoubyari/spring-boot-rest-example)
* Make sure you are using JDK 1.8 and Maven 3.x
* Build the project by running ```mvn clean package```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:

```
java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=test target/spring-boot-rest-example-0.5.0.war
OR
mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.arguments="spring.profiles.active=test"
```
